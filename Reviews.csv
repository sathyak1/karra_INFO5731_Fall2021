0,"I got to admit I wasn't particularly blown away by anything in the movie.. I might even say ""I was bored"" by it.Don't get me wrong.. it IS a spectacle! The action is great. The locations are nice, costume design, sound design, etc. But it is overall a soft release not worth seeing in theaters.. specially as a follow-up to what Endgame was.The biggest problem for me, is how the underwritten lead has muddled personality (for reasons covered in the story) devoid of charm, personality or good dialogue.The next issue is the humor, which didn't land for me.. Not once. The supporting lead Awkwafina isn't her normal ""loud"" self that's supposed to be funny every time she opens her mouth. Her role is very supportive and a little dramatic. And while I questioned myself why was she even there for, it doesn't ultimately matter. She is another forgettable character that is given more importance than the role deserves.Finally, the third act is weak. There's a balancing problem with stakes. You can't feel tension or weight to any action. And there's a lot of superficial ""I can't do it"" until they can.In the end, this feels like a very safe plot, written in a way to appeal to china (considering how the Mandarin is portrayed), that ends up appealing to no one specific. Certainly doesn't feel like a Marvel movie.. but it was bound to happen if we are to be introduced to different aspects of the narrative. But it also doesn't feel like a comic book. It's more generic than that."
1,"The characters are a bit incoherent and straight up contradict their own characterizations at times, because the plot needs them to do it. There are a bunch of unneeded ""deux-ex machina"" or conveniences because the writers trapped themselves into corners for no reason (that's what happens when you get the 2021 ""Mortal Kombat"", ""WW84"" and ""The Expendables"" writers).Also, we have Awkwafina destroying every type of scene (dramatic; epic; and also the comedic ones) with one of the worst ""acting"" I've ever seen and a same type of joke (""awkward nonsense"") over and over, from start to finish, with a role ridiculously large for a dumb comic relief.But... Liu is actually pretty good as a lead (and his character is potentially great), and the ""Shang-Chi world"" is beautiful and it has everything to be super fun to watch in the future...without Awkwafine and better writers."

Language: English
Source: Hotstar
RECOMMENDEDThe story and making is worth to watch in big screen with good sound system. The first half is filled with great actions and funny moments and it get into serious mode in the second half.The second half is more traditional and sentimental....the decent story and colourful visual makes this so grand...
Good movie to watch with family."
3,"Everything comes in it beautiful science fiction and beautiful mythical creatures. Sometimes you have creatures that don't seem real, but these just seemed real. Well done! There was a bit of avatar feeling in it. Fighting for the safekeeping of peace. Really beautiful. And self-acceptance was also nicely incorporated."
4,"The story was riddled with holes and plot issues. Since when does Awkwafina's pedestrian character all of a sudden get invited to become part of the MCU team? What's her super power... stupidity? Don't get me wrong, I love her, but her character was lazily written. Then there's the whole daddy issues dynamic - Shang is with him, then against, then with etc.. Then we have these ridiculous dragons fighting, where one scores some power crystals and becomes stronger! This is just infantile lazy writing. There was zero shock value or anything spectacular in the entire runtime, with tedious long middle acts and a bumbling third act. The jokes were cliched and not funny. The funniest parts were Ben Kingsley's character, (of whom was in this for what reasons??) and the ending to go Karaoke - which was the only time I actually cracked a chuckle. You'd think with three writers we'd have something cohesive and coherent. But instead of a Marvel superhero story, we got a Disney evil vs good with dragons thrown into the mix. It's as if they tried too hard to create the Asian version of Black Panther.It's a shame, because the directing and cinematography were spot on, and great S/VFX - although a little overboard with the CGI i.e. Dragons. The martial arts choreography was outstanding (although again, overboard after the awesome bus scene), and the casting and performances were excellent, especially Leung, who pretty much carried the film on his shoulders. It's a 7/10 from me."
5,"Destin Daniel Cretton's 'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' marks a bland start to the new phase of Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is a spectacle with regards to action sequence and fighting choreography, but the film misses a solid storyline for an origin story as its titular character lacks personality and does not go through any heroic transformation story arc. Simu Liu has a strong presence as Shang-Chi, yet he is overshadowed by many of his more experienced co-stars."
6,"Shang-Chi is one of Marvel Comic's most unknown and underutilized characters in their comics, with his original comics containing a decent amount of racist imagery and embarrassing caricatures of various Asian stereotypes. At it's best, the MCU can turn any obscure group or concept from the comics into gold, and Shang-Chi is no different.Shang-Chi might be one of the best examples of an idea that's actually better on film than the original source material, with the character's relationships, motivations, and place in the overall Marvel Universe all being improved upon in the film adaptation as opposed to the comics where he's mainly a hand-to-hand expert with no powers or special weapons, and isn't generally of much value to The Avengers.Simu Liu is charismatic and athletically gifted enough to do solid justice to the lead role. I hope the sequel gives him even more to do with his character and his legacy, but for an introduction, this was great. Awkwafina, Michelle Yeoh, and of course the legendary Tony Leung all lend their talents to a great cast of characters.Wen Wu is easily one of the top villain/antagonist characters in the MCU and probably all of comic book films. He's intimidating and masterful as a ruler, but heartfelt and believable as a family man. His presence elevates the entire production as he's a legend of cinema.There's moments reminiscent of Black Panther, and the third act gets heavy into Chinese mythological imagery, but understand that this is not only meant as a superhero movie, but also a love-letter to Chinese storytelling and culture.Shang-Chi features some of the best physical/non-super powered fight scenes in the MCU, with the choreography and the cinematography of said action taking a higher level. As soon as I saw the bus fight scene in the opening I had no worries about this part of the movie.The Ten Rings themselves are not a weapon used in the comics, and are a wonderfully creative, versatile, and visually stunning weapon unlike anything I've ever seen before, and that's not an easy thing to say having seen as much comic book and sci-fi material as me.Some of the pacing and character development could be a little better, but overall Shang-Chi is on the higher end of Marvel movies, and can also be solidly enjoyed by audiences totally unfamiliar with Marvel in general."
7,"I am not a big fan of the many, many Marvel films. The only reason I saw this one was that my oldest daughter insisted I watch it....and overall I was impressed by the movie, though I think it was enjoyable more for the insane eye candy than the story itself.I could talk about the plot but just noticed that there are over 2000 reviews for this film. So, I'll just say that it looked great and would have been great to have seen it on the big screen. The story itself, though enjoyable, wasn't one that particularly grabbed me or impacted on me...possibly because it was so violent and frenetic that the film, as a consequence, lacked intimacy and humanity."
8,"I'll be honest - Marvel movies are not in my top 20 or even 50 but within the Marvel ""Universe"" I would say that Shang-Chi is in my top 5. I know, it's blasphemy and all that but think about it - is it better than Iron Man? I would admit yes - it's origin story is arguably better, and it's characters are a lot deeper. The Mandarin is a conflicted man, with evil but good as well, like real life. Is this movie better than The Avengers or Ragnarok or Infinity Wars? Hard to say, which means it's right up there with the best (of Marvel) in my opinion.Plus, I'm a sucker for Chinese movies with the Chinese language being spoken - 1 of my favourite of all times, if not my absolute favourite, is of course 'Hero.' The Chinese language and the artistry of it's culture are magnificent.All in all, well done Marvel, director Destin, and all those who worked to make this movie a reality. This is not just your average summer action movie; it's close to being a Masterpiece. And the humour is pretty swell too!Cheers."
9,"The best marvel movie after Endgame. The story is a bit clich√© but the rest is absolutely amazing. The fight scenes are the best in the MCU in my opinion. Simu Liu as Shang-Chi is perfectly chosen and all the other characters are nice and the all the actors do a good job. Act 3 is on another level that we haven't seen before in MCU and the visual effects are spectacular, by far one of the best origin stories from Marvel!"
10,"Watched the IMAX version! Best solo since Iron Man (2008)! I had no expectations of this before. But the movie is much more lively. Enjoyed every moment. And also very engaging from start to finish. A kinda Cute-Action movie with some fun stuff!This is the first movie that focuses more on martial arts than Marvel's superpower thing. Love to see a mix of Marvel's MASTER-LEVEL-CGI with Martial art. Kung-Fu with this kind of visual effect! Marvel nailed it again.I've always loved Marvel's casting. Katy is too perfect for her role. Loved her chemistry with Shaun. Also laughed out loud at her childish stuffs.Just one thing, not a big deal, the action scene of 'Dragon Riding' doesn't fit into the usual Marvel movie. But as Chinese flavor, it is OK. Except for this, the cinematography and VFX are a lot mesmerizing!"
11,"Shang-Chi is a boring film. The characters were okay, but the story was choppy and confusing. The song choices were odd. Plus, this movie was way too long. And the scene at the end had me practically falling asleep."
12,"Simple as that, it's worth watching. Luckily I had Subtitles on for the Chinese speaking parts, and that helped, especially at the start of the movie (about 10 minutes). Don't forget the end credit scene at 2:01:46."
13,"Let's agree that it is a bad movie from multiple points of view. It depends a lot on the visual effects, its main characters can be funny but not nice, the story does not generate much interest and we have seen the fights many times and in a better way in almost any film produced in Hong Kong, Indonesia or Thailand of the last twenty years. The only thing that saves this film is the karaoke scene that is unexpectedly welcome. The rest is routine, mediocre, tiring and bland."
14,"Shaun (Simu Liu) and Katy (Awkwafina) are slackers in San Francisco. Well, they're Chinese slackers which means that they still have jobs. They're just dead-end jobs. Unbeknownst to Katy, Shaun's real name is Shang-Chi and he was trained from childhood to fight by his father Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) who has been conquering for a thousand years with the Ten Rings until he met the love of his life, Shang-Chi's mother.This is MCU doing an Asian hero and it's actually pretty funny. Awkwafina does her comedic thing. Simu Liu does a good every-man performance but he's also a good straight man to Awkwafina. I like the pairing although they may be better as friends. Then the movie surprises with a comedic turn from Ben Kingsley. I love that part which gave the movie a comedic jolt. I wouldn't mind him popping up in other MCU stuff. The dragon fight is a little blah but those climatic battles are getting standardized anyways. This is a fine addition to the MCU and these are fun characters to add to the gang."
15,"It was an okay movie. Simu Liu is the son of the seemingly immortal master of the Ten Rings --always good to see Tony Leung, and I hope he soaked Disney --who winds up opposing his dad, and Awkwafina is his slacker sort-of girlfriend. They are fine in the leads, as is Meng'er Zhang as his sister, and Michelle Yeoh as their aunt -- always good to see her, and I hope she soaked Disney too.I have grown increasingly fond of martial arts films over the last couple of decades, and the decline of the movie musical is the reason why. They don't make movies like that any more, and when they try, they're often embarrassing. People don't like the unreality of people bursting out into song, or expressing their emotions through dance. No, they prefer the solid commonplace of people floating through space to kick each other in the head. To me, the fight choreography is its own dance, and the fight between Leung and Fala Chen when they meet and before they fall in love is a challenge dance as graceful as any between Astaire and Rogers.There are problems aplenty with this film. There's an immense amount of exposition, starting off with twenty minutes of it in Chinese. I'm not sure why Ben Kingsley as the fake 'Mandarin' from IRON MAN 3 is present except for a certain remnant of star power and connecting this to the rest of the MCU. Still, with my expectations not set particularly high, I had a good time."
16,"Really entertaining movie. Actors were great Simu Liu brought it big time he is excellent as the main character. Awkwafina is hilarious and I wish she had more screen time. As far as Marvel movies goes, it's not the best one but still very good."
17,"I've said this before about Marvel movies: they are a victim of their own success. ""Shang-Chi"" had to follow up a decade and a half of quality MCU movies, so the same movie that would've been a smash 10 years ago isn't viewed quite the same today. The movie was good, but it failed to really separate itself.""The Legend of Ten Rings"" as a title already sounds too much like LOTR. And in fact it was something like it in that he with the rings had the power. Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung) had the ten rings which gave him near omnipotence. With the ten rings he could defeat entire armies and live forever. He decided to use the rings to become a tyrant.He was willing to put his rings aside and grow old for the love of his life, a woman he found after living 1000 years. I thought it was a bit strange that it took the man 1000 years to find his true love, but I didn't dwell on it.Stranger than him taking a thousand years to find his true love was the woman who fell in love with him. She lived in a secret magical village in Macao that was totally isolated from the rest of the world. She was a gentle benign character who had powers herself and was able to defeat Wenwu when he came to essentially conquer her village. Somehow, through their Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon-esque battle they fell in love. Maybe that makes sense for him being that he finally found someone who could defeat him, but it didn't make sense for this nearly pure woman to fall for a man with a 1000 year history of tyranny.Still, they wed, forsook their powers and started a family.Their family would be unceremoniously destroyed when an old foe of Wenwu--a vicious gang--came by their house to get their pound of flesh and killed Wenwu's wife, Li (Fala Chen). Li could've attempted to barter with them for some sort of material exchange for their past losses, but instead she immediately decided she'd try to fight the entire gang and lost her life in the process. That would cause Wenwu to don the ten rings again and return to tyranny.So, if you're keeping score on Wenwu's wife, 1.) she was smitten with a man who came to destroy her village and 2.) she chose to fight an entire gang with no powers to speak of and with no attempts to negotiate.I recognize that it was a plot device to advance the plot, but it could've been done a lot better and with more tact. Her character never struck me as someone impulsive and/or not able to judge character yet she exhibited both flaws.Most of what I've covered was garnered throughout the movie via flashbacks. The real main character was Saun aka Shang-Chi (Simu Liu). He was the son of Wenwu and Li. Years later we see an adult Saun. He lives in SF and is a valet. He is violently thrust back into the life he ran away from when his father's goons came for the pendant around his neck given to him by his mother. It was at this point we learned his backstory, of which I've given some already. We find out he also has a sister, Xialing (Meng'er Zhang), who Disney not so subtly informed us she had to train herself to become a fierce warrior because of her gender. The two of them had been split up for close to twenty years when Saun ran away after being trained to be an assassin by his father. He was fourteen at the time and she was ten when he promised her he'd be back. He never came back and when they met again in Macao as adults she held the same ten-year-old bitterness against him for running away as though a fourteen-year-old should've been more reliable. She greeted him with a butt-kicking that was twenty years in the making. It's clear that it never crossed her mind that he may have been killed, or maybe she would've considered his death a betrayal as well. Either way it was a completely childish way to handle reuniting with your long lost brother.The two of them would join forces along with Saun's friend Katy (Awkwafina) and really quickly to stop their father. He was going to use the ten rings to breach a portal to another dimension which contained some soul-sucking demons.The introduction of demons to the movie did offer some excitement. It upped the stakes of everyone involved and thrust another Marvel character into the role of saving the world.Saun would save the world with the help of his friends and family. Some would die, but the most important characters lived. I was somewhat satisfied with the movie. The acting was commendable and Awkwafina was good as the comic relief. ""Shang-Chi"" may just be the placement of a singular brick to build to something bigger, I just hope what Marvel is building towards is worth it."
18,"Martial arts meets the MCU in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. More Crouching Tiger than Jackie Chan, the plot for the film is kinda hum-drum, the sort of mystical Eastern fantasy cobblers that practically writes itself.Shang-Chi is the son of immortal, power-hungry warlord Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) and Li (Fala Chen), a warrior woman from the hidden village of Ta Lo. After falling in love with Li and becoming a father, Wenwu gives up his wicked ways and packs away the ten legendary rings that gave him much of his power. However, after his wife is killed by his old enemies, Wenwu once again wears the rings and trains his son to become an assassin. Ashamed of what he has become, Shang-Chi goes into hiding in America and becomes Shaun (Simu Liu), but his past eventually catches up with him when his father sends his army, The Ten Rings, to steal the pendants given to him and his sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) by their mother. Wenwu requires both pendants to reveal the way to Ta Lo, where he believes that his wife is being held captive by her people.This Marvel movie is at its most fun before the plot starts to get in the way and the CGI becomes too overbearing and intrusive: the early fight scenes - a battle on a runaway bus against a henchman known as Razor Fist, and a fight on some high-rise bamboo scaffolding - deliver lots of impressively choreographed action that will please both martial arts fans and superhero addicts. Awkwafina, as Shang-Chi's loyal friend Katy, provides some comic relief, but also gets stuck in with the action.Unfortunately, the film quickly goes downhill after the good guys make their way to Ta Lo, with a little help from Tony Slattery (see Iron Man 3) and a furry winged creature with no face. The inevitable battle between the villagers and Wenwu's army is typical overblown Marvel mayhem, but the massive CGI tsunami arrives when Wenwu opens the inter-dimensional gate that he thinks is holding Li prisoner: instead of releasing his wife, he frees a swarm of flying tentacled soul-suckers and their big bad boss The Dweller. Fortunately for the Ta Lo people, they have a massive magical dragon on their side, which wakes up and adds to the digital whizz-bangery.As technically impressive as the special effects are, I found the second half of the film visually overwhelming yet remarkably uninvolving - a whirlwind of pixels and noisy action without much substance.5/10. It was nice to see HK/Chinese stars Michelle Yeoh, Tony Leung and Yuen Wah together in a Marvel movie; I just wish it had been a better one."
19,"It had potential but marvel has this tendency of degrading everything into mindless comedy...Things just happen, to an extent where Awkwafina is now an avenger...
I'm getting too old for this s#.t.."
20,"As far as visuals go, this movie is amazing... like just about as impressive as Dune, it's filled to the brim with eye-candy.The plot/story however is mediocre and filled with plot holes... the characters' actions are often unrealistic and they will often just 'stare in awe' at their friends being killed, instead of doing the realistic thing, and immediately defending their friends... it's something that happens like 5 times and honestly spoils the movie for me.... if characters in a movie don't act or react realistically and stare at something like a braindead zombie (like their friends getting killed right in front of them, whilst they are holding a gun in their freeking hands), then it's just really terrible script/plot writing.Overall, the movie isn't as bad as Ant-Man 2 but it's not far behind. Also, Awkwafina's acting style was already old by the 2nd movie she did... ALL of her characters in movies are the same person, and like I said, it got boring after the 2nd movie. I roll my eyes at everything Awkwafina's character does in the movie.It's a 5/10 movie, not really worth a watch unless you're a real die-hard Marvel fan."
21,"This was just a lot of fun. The story wasn't as tight as it could have been, but I found myself enjoying the whole movie regardless. The fight choreography was bangin', and all the action was just very well directed. Everything felt purposeful and exhilarating. The beginning of the movie feels like a straight-up martial arts movie and then as it progresses we get more and more fantasy elements working their way in which felt like a nice contrast. The music definitely felt like it added a lot here. I kept being reminded of how mixing different elements in with the more traditional orchestrated sounds really worked for Black Panther's soundtrack, and I honestly think this film did it even better. I think that, all in all, this is probably the best thing Marvel has produced since Endgame."
22,"I liked the first half of this film and I thought it was a fine addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The backstory with the father and the mother was a nice wuxia inspiration and a cool way of introducing the Chinese theme to Marvel. The protagonist and Awkwafina had a believable friendship that struggled to balance enjoyment with living up to expectations. The tensed family relationship was a great focus as the father's gravity and charisma almost matched that of Thanos and feels like a truly deep human being. Throughout, the fight choreography was amazing, especially the bus scene.The second half was an obligatory CGI mess that takes the focus away from the family relationship. The epic legendary city of Ta Lo (Chinese version of Wakanda) is about thirty people living in a wooden village. That's all that stands between the world and a world-destroying demon, apparently. The hyped up final battle involves about ten soldiers with tasers. Wasn't the Ten Rings supposed to be a world-spanning empire? The fight between the dragons was so fast-paced that I couldn't tell what was going on.That said, there are flaws that occur in both of the halves. The Ten Rings (the organisation) is very vague in its nature and impact. Why are they so feared? How have they taken over the world? What are they capable of? Show, don't tell! The Ten Rings (the artifacts) don't seem to do much beyond flying around and projecting energy. This is cool, but it seems like a step down from other cosmic jewellery and probably didn't deserve the praise in the post-credit scenes.P. S. Trevor and Morris were definitely highlights of the film! Keep this up, Marvel!"
23,"I really liked that the actors spoke their native language, Mandarin, because it would've felt too Americanized otherwise. But there was something unfinished about this movie and I'm not sure what it is. The pacing was alright, a little too slow or fast at times, and as far as storylines go, it was not as exciting as I thought it would be. The fight scenes were great though, especially the final grand battle scene."

25,"You could be mistaken for reading the title and thinking I was being sarcastic.Thankfully,I'm not. Just wow. I've been longing for that wow factor from the cinema since cinemas have reopened and this film gave me everything I wanted.Take away the fact that I am biased towards Marvel movies (guilty) this however is just a fanboy loving that Marvel have delivered once again, by that I mean top tier movies in the realms of Black Panther, Thor 3, GOTG, Infinity wars, Spider-Man just to name a few.From not having any major comic runs, to coming to our screens with this is jaw dropping movie, I can only show nothing but pure joy. From the culture, the mythical folklore, the mix of past/present and let's not forget the secret garden this film expands on the Marvel universe once again with an even deeper history.This film gave me real belly laughs, real emotional moment, a fantastic soundtrack to match this is a genuine winner for this year and Spider-Man may have his hands full beating what I can only describe as the best introduction to a unknown character since BP/GOTG. Shang-Chi needs to be a new staple in the Marvel franchise with new stories moving forward. Not to mention that fantastic performance from Simu Liu which has genuinely made me yearn for more of his portrayal!What an absolute treat and I've only watched it twice with a third viewing feeing more needed as the days go on.5 star all day, every day. Bravo!"
26,To see Sir Ben Kingsley reprise his role as comedy relief for a movie that already has us suffering through another Awkafina performance is sad and redundant. This is what happens when Disney and Marvel try too hard to find a path forward after Endgame. The Asian theme is new but the vague attempts to tie the movie to the MCU smack of desperation. This is just not a good movie. A lot of expensive visuals but that does not make a movie good. Lots of narrative and exposition to explain the visuals but that does not make the movie good or interesting. I understand that it is show business and this movie was made to make money but if I hadn't been lucky enough to watch it on Disney+ I would feel cheated.
27,This is the worst marvel movie I have seen to date.after seeing the movie I was honestly surprised by all the high ratings. Did we watch the same thing? The movie is without a soul. Characters aren't build up enough even with a 2 hour run time. The movie literally got nothing to do with the ten rings. Movie became Godzilla vs King Kong at the end. Waste of 2 hours. Honestly clueless why people high praised for this movie. What a waste of opportunity to create a wonderful and authentic world for Asian marvel universe.
28,"Ben Kingsley won this movie. And it was not particularly close. Probably the stunt coordinator came in a distant second? Anyway, I did laugh quite a bit, and the fight scenes were better than your average Marvel film...but not everything was better than average. Most of it was just about average, actually. Special effects: average. Characterization: average. Plot twists: average. I still enjoyed myself, and still appreciated Marvel transforming an exploitative property into something culturally rich. But the diminishing returns of Marvel joints continues."
29,"....and that's at least the minimum you'd want from this type of action film. And that bus scene, whhooo! I also loved the mixture of languages in some scenes (I don't have a problem with subtitles). All of the leads are well cast, as are several supporting characters, and the script is pretty tight."
30,"What a great flick. The action was amazing throughout, constantly growing and changing so the fights never got boring. Awkwafina is a favourite of mine and did a great job. Family relationships really do make the most compelling of stories. We got an Antagonist that had a tragic and understandable story, he never felt 1 dimensional like so many other hero rising villains."
31,This film is a love letter to Asia. The creatures the atmosphere the fights. They really took their time with this. Many people complain about final fight but if you watch anime or know of anime you should know better.
32,"I was not expecting that, I had visions of a film along the same lines as Snake Eyes, that was an out of date bagel, this was a four course banquet.Fast paced, energetic, and relentless, not particularly the genre I normally go to, or enjoy, but I loved every second of it, a visual masterpiece. Superb acting, terrific musics, but it's produced in such a magical way, it is stunning.I plan on seeing this again, just to understand a few bits a little more.Go and watch it, you'll love it, 9/10."
33,"I've watched this movie twice so far and I thought I'd enjoy it less on the rewatch, but I found it just as good.Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a very epic introduction to this character and keeps you invested in his origin story. While it's definitely not the most original story, they do a good job at making the character relatable enough to keep you emotionally invested.Awkwafina was a nice addition to the movie and while some of her jokes were pretty corny, they still made me laugh (even on rewatch).The highlights of the movie are definitely the bus scene near the beginning and the final beautiful action sequence. But all the action in general in this movie is pretty amazing.While it has a different vibe than most MCU movies, the formula is definitely still there. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it would have been nice for this movie to have a bit more of a unique story.Otherwise this is a stunning cinema experience, and even watching at home it will make you feel like you're in a movie theatre. Definitely recommend!"
34,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings takes place some time after Avengers Endgame is the beginning of phase four of the marvel cinematic universe.Shang-Chi is an alright movie. It has some great fight scenes with some incredible fight choreography and epic large-scale battles. It is also has some good comedic scenes that made me laugh a couple of times. Where Shang-Chi suffers is when it comes to the plot. I didn't find the story very compelling and I didn't get that attached to the characters. It's a story that I feel has been done many times before.Shang-Chi wasn't for me but it's comedy and fight scenes make up for some of it's flaws. If you are familiar with the Marvel franchise I assume you somewhat know what to expect and for you I can recommend it. Although the movie isn't that great, I still think it's good enough to the point of where it's worth watching just to keep up with the larger plot of the MCU. For those not invested in the MCU, I don't believe that this movie is the one you should start with."
35,Nice mixture of marvel universe and eastasian movie art. Great fight scenes and special effects.Lovable characters and a good story. And the dragon was just cool.
36,"As far as Marvel being a fantasy film they generally like to be grounded in reality of history of the world and the current setting... but this one is really really going into the fantasy setting of parallel universes of Chinese myth. So for me it kinda felt totally fantastical and not really connected to any of the other Marvel universe.The fight and chorography of the action scenes is impressive and entertaining and if a movie could be watched on that basis alone then this would do the job - unfortunately for Shang Chi you actually need a compelling story with interesting characters.... but what we got was the MASSIVELY overdone .. evil father and son who seeks redemption arc... other supporting characters were pretty much all one dimensional - either good or bad, black or white.I also felt that Samuel Liu was miscast in the main role... If Donnie Yen was younger he probably would have done a better job. Samuel just does not have the screen presence.Its entertaining for the kids but I think the adults will be bored."
37,"I'll start by saying that if you're looking for a great story, you'll be disappointed. Shang-Chi is a pretty standard hero's journey at its core, which is a shame because the story could have been inspired by House of Flying Daggers and other wuxia titles.So why a rating so high? Because where the story falls, everything else excels.Shang-Chi is visually spectacular and a real treat for the eyes with some visuals that are incredibly distinct for the MCU. In regards to aesthetics, Black Panther walked so Shang-Chi could run a marathon.The fight scenes are all amazing. There's one weak fight, but it's meant to be weak, and they're all very long, which is great to see. One of the early ones went on for a solid 5 - 10 minutes, which was unexpected but far from disappointing.The first actual fight scene is my favourite in the MCU, and I was worried none of the others would top it, but they were all delightful to watch, and I was so glad they did a parallel of it later on. Either way, the writers went hard on the fight scenes and that paid off.In summary, the story is lacking, but I'm glad in a way because that allowed everything else to shine. And shine, it did. I hope future directors take lessons from the aesthetics and choreography of Shang-Chi."
38,"Lots of copied ideas from other films, and poorly executed. Very tossed together & cheaply not realistic.The usual opening scene of vast armies on plains with the usual barrage of arrows. The Army of the Ten Rings is led by the usual immortal who, as usual, steals ten arm bracelets which as usual are suppose to be hidden because of their power to, as usual bring immortality & create immense destructive force. The seen before Disney style fantasy creatures (same old lion, horse, dragons, odd little creatures). The usual electrical, laser, and pressure force as our weapons. Redundant, boring, cheap to digitally reproduce. Possessor supposedly over a thousand + years develops an army that for centuries (up until now) has spread to every corner of the world (odd, I never heard of them)."
39,"Cretton is an amazing director, and he like totally proves it here once again. I love the way he tells stories, and Shang-Chi is finally not just like every other mindless Disney film of their new big franchises. The action is worth it compared to other Marvel films, and the acting is to be expected as great considering at least Disney knows how to hire actors, albeit they don't let people often tell real stories. Go watch this! Somewhere! Anywhere! Everywhere!"
40,"What an amazing movie by Marvel Studios! I was hyped for the movie since the first teaser and the movie actually exceedes my expectations. Marvel has been showing its MARVELous magic since Ironman, and Shang-Chi is another diamond in the crown. After the end of MCU's phase 3, fans were eagerly waiting for a big movie. Black Widow was not up to the mark and Eternals also disappointed majority of fans, but Chang-Chi filled their gap. The action scenes were fresh and engaging. Martial arts combined with chinese mythological powers makes these action scenes more interesting. Character arc and story building were satisfying. They were not rushed or slow paced. Whole movie was engaging till the end. I would love to see another movie of this franchise."
41,"Hollywood trying to be too woke about being Chinese.Always hate it when they make a villain not really a villain as to not offend anyone. Shang Chi's father is supposed to be a pure villain, the mother storyline took away a lot from the real storyline.Awkwafina's character becoming a boss archer after one day of training was equally ridiculous.Hopefully if a sequel is made it will be darker, though I'll admit the Mandarin was a funny touch."
42,"Movie has a lot of stuff to keep you hooked.1. VFX. Whole movie is visually stunning
2. Stunt choreography is awesome. Probably the best in MCU so far imo.3. Background score. I felt goosebumps everytime the main theme kicks in. Soundtrack is good too.4. Decent acting except the one who played Shang chi's father who had a menacing screen presenceDespite of the perfectly blended Chinese culture and the MCU's successful (so far) action formula, this movie isn't free from cliche moments. I just wished the second half was less predictable and had something more to offer."
43,"Whoa! I watched Shang-Chi because I wanted to put something on in the background and I just ended up getting invested!I would go to say this is one of the best singular films in the MCU. I found films such as Thor and Black Panther slightly boring. They are full of information but I just couldn't get invested as much as I wanted too. I'd slightly fallen out of my obsession with the MCU over the past couple of years, but Shang-Chi could help bring my obsession back.It's about so many things at once, but the main plot is basically about Shang-Chi trying to find family with his friend Katie. That's the best way to describe it without minor spoilers. I believe this film really represented the culture well, and the scenery really helped to intrigue me to keep watching longer. The characters are all pretty likeable too and the fight scenes were amazing!A criticism I would have, which I have with many Marvel films, is that I feel like some scenes dragged on a little too long, but that's me really picking in details. I also found it hard to follow the plot at one point, but I soon picked back up what was happening.I really recommend this, even if you're not a fan of the MCU. I'd say it's one of Marvels strongest movies that has released recently! Really looking forward to where Marvel takes this series next."
44,One of the best marvel movies in a decade. Cinematography acting jokes background score everything is on point according to story scene & actors action scenes hand to hand combat is on another level.
45,"From Beginning to End I enjoyed this movie. It is well done, The characters are well written and honestly, I would love to see more Shang Chi and other characters in future marvel Movies and TV Shows. I love how Phase 4 is going so far, I can not wait to see more of the Expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe in Movies and TV Shows. Overall, Fantastic Film!"
46,"I thought this movie would suck honestly when i heard it was being made, i thought shang chi is a terrible character with no powers and then i always dread hollywood making asian movies lol.Im chinese by the way and when i finally watched it i was blown away!!! This was best movie of the year, maybe one of the best marvel movies that didnt involve a blockbuster teamup like avengers infinity wars and end game.So action packed, excellent script, insane graphic visuals, insane fighting choreography, alot of character depth and explorations. Well made indeed! This is the Black panther movie for all asians! I say all asians because chinese culture has affected all asian countries in the last 3000 years.Dont let the reviews bother you, alot of these people dont know what their talking about honestly. Seen 1 person mention theirs no villain But this movie takes villain into an indepth look. For every villain theirs a drive & purpose to why they do things and for this villain it involved love. Some may not be able to comprehend this as they view villains stone cold killers maybe or just destructive no emotion type of baddies.They wrote the script for this villain amazingly considering he was originally the Mandarin (a very stereotypical villain hated by asians). The clever way they were able to remove that racist heritage to this character was flawless, funny and amazing.I mean cmon it was hilarious the way the villain described how his name came.Some even complained they got lost during the whole movie which i found it hard to believe. I mean you must have Low IQ lmao go not understand n follow through the movie. From beginning to end it was a step through step process. Maybe they could have explored more about the magical lands but whois to say they wont in future movies?? All u needed to know was in the movie, and any other questions can be saved for the future just as most marvel movies always do.The fight scenes on the Bus were off the charts and so was the rest of it. I can see theirs many chinese people hating on this film cuz they feel the fighting style is too like Chinese movies fighting style But they dont get it. What made this movie very good was the amazing way they blended chinese and western movies together. The fight scenes was neither just chinese nor was it western, it was a perfect blend.This stories villajn was writting the way Thanos was but better. Thanos was not just crazy mad villain, he had purpose and feelings and goals that involved not just world domination or killing. Same with this villain, Tony Leung may have had not many lines in this movie but the way he carried his presence and the acting was outstanding.I have watched tony leung in hong kong movies for 30 years now and his acting is impeccable. He brought life to the Villain he played, and gave it a more down to earth and also relatable character portrayal. Anyone in his position in the movie would have had a chance to go his path, i know many might disagree but it was so easy to see how he deviated from the good path he took for some time back to evil. You just need to understand the character and his reasons and experiences.The main character Sima Liu i mean was pretty good choice, their were some scenes for fighting that looked to be him doing the stunts and it was amazing.I seen some complain that the movie should have been just mandarin but thats clearly a comment made by someone from China or mandarin speaking. To them they live in the old age where black is black, white is white, theirs no grey.Only way asians can move forward in hollywood is by a blend of both west n east.Maybe some people might hate it cause its so much asian characters n that its got mandarin language in it, then u got others who hate it cuz theirs english in it. Both groups need to grow up and live in the year 2021 cuz this movie was so successful because of the mixture of both cultures in 1.If this movie was just another straight chinese martial arts flick it would certainly not be successful in the west. This blend is what makes it open up to other races to watch and enjoy.The special effects of the movie was off the charts! Amazing!! The fighting too!This movie is the Black panther for asians. Its the opening door for asians to be introduced more commonly.If anyone in or from China reads this i think u should think hard to yourself, Do you want to see more chinese movies succeed in the future?? Cuz if so then u should ccheer this movie on cause its gonna open doors for chinese actors n actresses.China blocking this movie from playing makes no sense as the way for China to spread love is share their culture with all especially after the pandemic fiasco. This movie opens the doors of chinese culture up to westerners.So support this movie! And stop bashing it for unfounded selfish reasons."
47,"The music, the screenplay, the writing, the direction everything was on point. I went to a theatre to watch it and was literally stunned. I crave that background music. It's simply too good. Ultimately. Go for it. Best 2 hours you'll have. Wont regret it."
48,This film felt refreshing and didn't feel too much like a marvel movie. Felt like I was just watching a mythological modern film.I had a good time watching it. Only downside was some of the CGI felt very rushed at some points. But Iwas willing to overlook it as I think it is worth the watch.
49,"Everybody around me raved about this movie, but I watched it very late and now I'm slightly disappointed. It didn't live up to all the hype and all the praise but seemed very much like any other Marvel movie. But what I am truly impressed with, was the blend of martial arts in the MCU, it fit so perfectly. This wasn't just another movie with a sprinkle of Asian characters for representation, no this actually tells their story, speaks their language, and depicts the details. The fight scenes are fun, there is some light comedy, no gore, and the CGI was gooooood. The backstory and narration made the fantasy seem real.It pulled at my heartstrings when it connected to Iron Man, I did not see that coming though it certainly made up for my disappointment with Awkwafina (Katy). The movie had a lot of slow parts and parts where I was losing interest and seemed somewhat like a good vs evil movie? Come to think of it, it felt like a Disney movie trying to teach me about Asian cultures and the inherent good in the universe.I'll agree it was dramatic and stays with you as 20 minutes post the movie, I was trying to channel the universe with open palms and gentle hand motions. Not something I do every day."
50,"Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) discovers that his all-powerful and millennium-old father is about to launch an attack against the magical village where Shang-Chi's mother was born in the likely mistaken belief that his wife is not dead but is rather being held captive (there is more to the plot than one sentence can sum up but what does it matter... the story is just scaffolding for the special effects). Much fighting ensues but fortunately everyone eventually learns how to 'get along' when faced with a real threat. You have seen it all before: physics-defying martial arts, monsters who look like the recently swallowed strings of LED Christmas lights, conflicted heroes with wise-cracking 'comic relief' sidekicks (an awful Aquafina and an even more awful Ben Kingsley), giant melees featuring a variety of glowing weapons (but no blood), hyper-kinetic and hyper-implausible car/motorcycle chases, and a lot of clich√©d wisecracks, tough-guy dialogue, poseur slo-mo, and heroic vogueing (we're treated to the venerable three-point power landing/slide a number of times). The only novel thing the film has to offer is the excellent rendering of mythological beasts from Chinese culture; otherwise, it's an overly-long (132 minutes, which is 120 minutes too much Aquafina), derivative, repetitive, and ultimately boring entry in the bloated, jejune Micky Mouse-Marvel superhero franchise."
51,"I love all the movies from them but Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings is one of my favorite marvel movies, it really managed to make a very nice movie, the story is usually a gorgeous one, the characters are very nice and you become very invested in the movie.I was amazed at what good fight sequences are in the movie like this, the best since The Avengers 2012 and Captain America: The Winter Soldier 2014 maybe even better.The CGI is incredible, I only saw such special effects on Avatar.I have to say that I ran and saw the fight on the bus 5 times, it's awesome ... it manages to give you an energy boost, so cool
The story is extraordinary, Shang-Chi confronts the past he thought he left behind, when his father wants to reunite his lost family.Xu Wenwu played by Tony Leung is such a good villain, you understand why he does this, you empathize with him and although you know that the way he acts is wrong you understand his pain. Besides being a villain he is also my father and everything he wants to release his wife.A very good villain, certainly one of the best villains of this year.This movie blow me away, I love it. Lots of love from Bangladesh üáßüá©"
52,"Totally unpopular opinion here and I might be the only one, but I really didn't like it; even going into it with no expectations. I wasn't too keen on the movie in the first place, but I was swayed by everybody who watched it and said it was brilliant. What a mistake. I felt the movie was incredibly dull, generic, utterly cliched and stereotyped. Crap characters, formulaic plot, and not even all that funny. As soon as the movie opened with a Chinese battle banner and the twang of guzheng notes, I knew it would be bad. The action and fight scenes aren't even all that great: they relied way too much on CG. I feel like the action was nothing special: Jackie Chan (and Yuen Wah whom you'll see in Shang Chi) in his hey-day produced way better action and fights without CG. Back when The Matrix first came out, that was mind-blowing action that Western audiences haven't seen before. If you've seen any number of Hong Kong martial arts movies you'll know what I mean. The third act of the movie was a total rip-off of the last battle in How to Train Your Dragon. Also an absolute waste of great actors like Michelle Yeoh who was given nothing to do, she practically dialled in her part. Positives though: Tony Leung. He's the one redeeming grace of this terrible and lazy movie."
53,"One again the studio brings jokes and the dazzling visuals over a good character development. After one hour, you don't care for the characters. Dysfunctional drama in the family and the chosen one - we have seen this a million times.This is the first time I felt sleepy for an action movie. I feel like i wasted my money, despite availing the Super Tuesday offer. The Suicide Squad was far much better in terms of storyboard.Over-rated, like Black Panther
What's next - Shang-Chi: Origins?"
54,"People voted 8-10, rly? For what? Story line is primitive and the gaps filled with some martial arts. ""and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" there was no any legend at all, just rings which give some super powers we see them in the begging of the movie and at the end. Producers added Ben Kingsley and Benedict Wong to tailor Shang-Chi to other MCU movies, but it feels so disconnected like Billy Bob Thornton as a Santa in Bad Santa. Michelle Yeoh is playing Crouching Tiger again, it's so SAD that Hollywood does not give her non-kung-fu roles, she has talent for sure.In short, after 1hr I started to check my watch because the whole thing was so boring I just wanted it to end."
55,"I was excited for Shang-Chi. Infinity War and Endgame set the bar very high at the end of Phase 3. The MCU shows have been a mixed bag but Shang-Chi seemed exciting because the director has a decent track record and I hadn't heard of the character. I thought it would be a good way for the MCU to expand.But this is one of the most by-the-numbers superhero movies I've ever seen. Practically everything about it falls flat or feels superficial. The humour is obvious and lazy. The fighting is cool but the camera is too hyperactive to let me properly enjoy it. The CGI is over-used and seldom feels remotely convincing nor interesting.Although there's some backstory, it's boring and confusing. It's one thing to be told what happened in the past. It's much better if we understand why choices were made and feel the passage of time.As it is, I didn't relate to any of the characters much at all. Shaun and Katy are just annoying and frivolous. The villain is stubborn and not particularly intimidating. I probably liked Kingsley more than anyone else and his character could easily be removed without affecting the plot.The staging is incredibly artificial. So many shots contain characters simply standing in a line. Or walking in a line. It never feels natural. One part has the bad guys (Are they bad guys? Who cares?) park their jeeps in a row and then get out and stand in a row while the other army stand in, you guessed it, a row. This keeps happening.Some of the creature designs are kind of cool, like the dragons which look like stylised drawings rather than real creatures. But they lead nowhere. They aren't developed, nor hyped up before, just thrown in your face. Including the massive dragons at the end. To make a fight between giant, flying dragons boring is quite the achievement, but Shang-Chi pulls it off.Cliches abound in this bore-fest. The comedic relief sidekick learns archery in a day or two and saves the day with a ridiculous shot. Why didn't any of the archers who had years of training do the same thing? How can an arrow travel that far so easily? It cheapens everything. They didn't earn it, they just did it because that's what movies do, right?The physics are awful. Why do I care? Well, reality matters. I much prefer movies where things actually make sense than those where the pixels are having a seizure, characters say one-liners and there are no stakes or consistency at all. Ignoring physics means making up random events with no real danger, suspense or skill, on the part of the characters or the screenwriters.Shang-Chi is one of the most superficial movies I've seen for a while. Great entertainment for 10-year-olds, perhaps, but utterly dull to most true movie enthusiasts. The moments are forced and predictable. There's no magic, the music's forgettable, the acting and script tick boxes rather than engage you.At best, it has some colourful action and a few funny lines. It shows just how skillfully made good action movies are, including the Russo brothers MCU movies."

Story:
Shang-chi(Simu Liu) who is living in USA for 10 years with his best friend Katy(Awkwafina). After sometimee,he should go to his native town because of some reasons. How did he got that ten rings? THIS IS THE STORY.Must Watch!"
57,"Personally this is top 3 comic movie.As a fan of Chinese cinema from the 70's onwards the martial arts in this film was fluid.Now if only DC would do a kung fu based film, it's got by far the greatest martial arts masters on its roster.Shiva, David Cain, Bronze Tiger, Karate Kid, Casandra Cain, Richard Dragon and on and on.Maybe a real film of soul of the dragon."
58,I found this very slow moving and boring.Special effects are silly looking.Drags on. Ends. Tells you this is the start of a whole new Marvel strand. Oh dear.
59,"Started like a mix between martial art and the marvel universe. I found it something special and liked it a lot just until the journey starts and another world opens. From there on we came into a fiction world with dragons and monsters.It's there that this flick lost my attention towards the story. It takes a while before the action comes back in. But once the fights are on, the effects are really stunning.Mixed feelings aboutthe result, not bada fter all but with the other world coming in, it lost some points in the rating for me.Nevertheless, some funny parts here and there added and they worked out fine.Gore 0/5
Nudity 0/5
Effects 5/5
Story 3/5
Comedy 1/5."
60,"The movie is fine and thats about it. It is way overhyped and marvel fans just spam review 10 stars on anything marvel related for some weird reason.I dont know what else to say other than the story was predictable and the only good part was the visuals, the fighting and some of the actors."
61,"Solid pop corn film. Although the director tried not to look like a standard Marvel movie, I think he only succeeded to some extent. The first half of the film was very good, the story, and especially the impressive fight scenes. However, later in the film we constantly get some new elements, the story expands, there is not always an explanation, and the worst part of the film was my last fight because I think they went too far with special effects, for me personally it was not watchable. The bad guys overall were just solid, nothing special. Of course, at the end of the film we have a scene that shows us how to look for (at least) another film."
62,"Great start, especially the fight choreography between Shang Chi's parents. That was sheer awesome and so was the fight in bus where we got good humour as a bonus.But then story gets dragged out and turns weird.Instead of taking us to Shang Chi's universe which is about martial arts... we are to Dr. Strange's.Dark Door, a soul-consuming monster from another realm... It was like they borrowed elements just for the hell of it.Expected so much..."
63,The movie was awesome.much better then i expected............action was awesome and the plot was awesome too......acting was quite good.highly recomend seeing this.
64,"Best movie of the year. I waited for that kind of movie the whole year. It has comedy, fantasy, action, it keeps you on your toes, ... just great. Can't wait for part two."
65,"Shang-Chi is arguably the most original and entertaining origin story that Marvel's delivered in quite some time. Coming from someone who's slowly starting to get superhero fatigue from both sides of the aisle, this one delivers. It's a spectacle, and has a family drama that feel's Shakespearean at times. In many ways this is how I wanted the live-action version of Mulan to be."
66,"I went into this hoping for fresh ideas but with low expectations and BOY was I surprised. This film was amazing! The casting, script, acting and everything else in between. Marvel really smashed this."
67,"Judging by the level of other Marvel movies this was definitely a miss.There is no humour. No sense of fun. It feels like a generic kung fu movie and that we have seen it all before.. I saw the ending way before we got there and above all, it was boring.Awkwafina was intensely annoying as ever with her grating personality and spouting exposition all the time.Marvel are really missing the mark with a lot of their latest offerings, just phoning it in like with Star Wars movies."
68,"The movie was entertaining to some degree and followed the standard Marvel Universe formula. Trite, current day pop cultural references and jokes during the first half of the movie were cheap and certainly will be lost on audiences of the future. A few idiots in the theatre guffawed loudly at most of them. As usual, though, the women were strong, kind and intelligent and the men were dumb and evil. Are we to believe that the most evil man in the Universe, Xi, is going to change his evil ways and that his wife would have even married a mass murderer on the scale of Genghis Kahn or Vlad the Impaler? Of course she's killed by his enemies and he returns to a life of evil and sends his henchmen to kill his own children to retrieve some necklaces so he can read a map. I will say Xi was a badass, as were Shang's sister, Aunt, and pretty much every other character compared to Shang, who was soft and definitely not superhero material. Awkwafina was funny and entertaining as usual, overshadowing Shang in most scenes as his character was so forgettably boring. Even his Aunt could kick his butt. Loved Ben Kingsley as the Mandarin, extremely funny and his performance was genius. The outcome was the usual for Marvel Universe and even the pre-view for the next movie during the credits was lame; I guess they could only get Mark Ruffalo and Brie Larson, perhaps the only two Marvel Universe characters lamer than Shang, to set up the next movie."
69,"Haven't been much of a Marvel guy even with their biggest event films, but Shang Chi is solid. Story moves quick, lots of great characters, almost nonstop action scenes, and a finale that they hid from the trailers. I was definitely way more into it than I thought I'd be. Props to the team on this one!"
70,"An amazing movie (Original, great cast, nice soundtrack, CGI is just pure eye candy, good comical releaf as usual) and great addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe!!! Can't wait for what's to come!"

72,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021)Well what a pleasant surprise, very much in the style of Black Panther, this origin story was really great from start to finish.I saw this at the 3D 4DX at the O2 and we were thrown about, blown on, rained on and every other sensation at every turn it was fab-u-lus!We had some great acting some great humour and plenty of ""magic"", for Marvel fans after the lacklustre Black Widow, the disaster of the Winter Soldier.

Story is simple but so beautifully presented."
74,"""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is one of the best productions of Marvel Studios. I had very big expectations for this movie and it didn't disappoint, mostly because it's based on asian people and martial arts and I am a very big fan of this genre. Only the idea to make a Marvel's movie which is based on martial arts is very interesting, even If there are already some comics on which this movie is based on.The movie has all you could expect from a movie made of Marvel, but the special effects and the CGI are the strongest points of this one. I even regret it that I didn't watch it in a cinema, because it's clear that the movie has been made to put into the light the enormous ammount of special effects, on a big screen. I've also been impressed by the acting and even the storyline it's not bad. It's clear enough that is has been put a lot of effort in the well-making of this movie and it seems to me that they really achieved what they've wanted to.""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" it's a movie that shines through it's CGI, acting and storytelling."
75,I thought it was a great hero movie. It developed the character as well as others and felt like the story was complete. This story was over and now it's time for the next.
76,"Best fight scenes since the civil war airport scene. They mess up simply by trying to make the character 10 years younger then the actor is. But aside from that I thought it was awesome. Plenty of cool action fight scenes, goes a little off the rails at the end with way too much cgi for what was a relatively grounded movie to start. Great addition to MCU , especially after the quality level the shows have been."
77,What more do you want!What more do you want!A must watch for all ages and especially for those who don't like the typical SuperHero Marvel movies...
78,"The very first question to be asked would be, ""Why was this movie even made in the first place?"" It's one of those ones that tries to be too much and ultimately fails at everything. It starts off as a love story, then turns into ""Filthy Rich Asians,"" and then ends as a conventional action pic. A romantic feminist vibe is terribly present throughout the entire picture, which wouldn't be that bad if that was all it was about. But this movie has trouble settling on one single narrative. It's almost like an asian version of ""Rocky Horror Picture Show."" As is typical of this current generation of filmmaking, it's just another ""People running around doing things"" movie. The market is just saturated with these SFX garbage movies which this summer was full of!!"
79,"I watched this movie after Twitter was claiming it to be the best movie ever, so I went with high expectations, after watching what I found is movie was mediocre at best, the CGI was great but apart from it everything is just ok at the best, I didn't connect with any character at all. To be honest wait for the film to come on streaming services, not worth it to go to the cinema."
80,Marvel are in desperate need of good writers!The story and script are both confusing and beyond cheesey !It really saddens me as I was once a big Marvelfan but since the passing of Stan Lee and Disney taking over it has produced a lot of trash!The Marvel I once enjoyed will never be the same it has been turned into yet another Disneyfied production.
81,"I liked this movie, one of the first American movie where a lot of the dialog is in Chinese. The movie in it self is not fantastic but is has it's moments. I just can't stop thinking about why this hd to be set in the Marvel universe, it makes no sense to me...but then I am no Marvel fan. I think it would have been much better a completely chinese movie set in a different universe separate from Marvel. But hey, this is an American movie after all."
82,"Overall this movie exceeded my expectations. I wish I had gone to see it in theatres because visually, this movie is stunning. All the fight scenes, especially the ending would have looked even cooler on the big screen.But stepping back and thinking about the actual story, it's kind of random, predictable at times and I'm not seeing how they're going to incorporate it into the rest of the MCU.The other thing is the fight scenes: the choreography, the cinematography, the effects, they were great, and I think they knew that, so they took advantage of it. During the first half of the movie there would be a new fight scene every fifteen minutes that looked fantastic, but seemed to last just a bit too long.All in all I liked it. The acting was pretty good, the pacing was reasonable, the soundtrack was unique and the visual effects were a strongpoint It was a good movie."
83,"The goal of an MCU solo film is to sell the audience on a new character and power system. This movie does both perfectly, within the first 30 minutes we are drawn to Shang as a character and that lasts throughout the entire movie. The fight scenes have love and care poured into them and I hope they bring this team back for future MCU movies involving Shang because they pay homage to old kung fu movies beautifully."
84,"Well in short
This comes under my top 5 worst marvel movie
My god.. Nothing interesting in this movie, not even the final battleüòë
There's like no suspense at all
And the main characters going to learn everything in like minutes, no need Of training, just be main characterüòë"
85,This new marvel movie is just bad. The main actor can't act and it's more about the side characters then him.
86,"Truly an amazing movie! This movie depicts family very well. The visual effects are stunning, the martial arts are incredible, and there is just enough humor in it to relieve some of the darker notes. I can't wait for the sequel!"
87,"It is not many times that you come out of the cinema with your friends and laugh about how bad a movie is but here we are. This is the Lowest of the low and this franchise has become nothing but a joke. Katy is the worst character in cinema history just shut up please jar jar 2.0, this is a disgrace to my eyes and dc is clear I see that now. If you like this movie you have problems."
88,"This movie was stunning. From the visual effects to the heart of the story to the phenomenal cast. I laughed, I cried and sat on the edge of my seat. Well worth taking the risk during the pandemic to go see this one in the theater. The music was great as well. Will definitely buy it when it comes out for rewatch. One of the best Marvel movies IMO."
89,"At last , after all super heroes , being overused by tired clich√©s , I'm really impressed by the introduction of traditional Chinese martial arts fantasy creature feature new Marvel film ! Stunningly visually beautiful , with some crazy fights ! One of the very best!!!"
90,"Keeping it short. This movie had it all. Great story, writing, direction, acting, villain, comedy and fight direction.I'm a huge old school kung-fu movie fan and I was a bit sceptical about how they will show the fight scenes. Glad they kept it authentic with the fight director (who worked with Jackie Chan a lot). It was insane.The story itself was superb. The villain's character development was amazing. The direction was not rushed and at the same time it didn't bore me for a single second.Best non-avengers MCU movie for me. I can watch this again today after watching it last night."
91,"A tad too heavy on the CGI and a bit too much wire work, making it more like ""crouching tiger"" in some of the fight scenes, but definitely one I'll enjoy re-watching."
92,"As an adult, I think this movie is a complete mess. The ancient master gets knocked out quickly while the car driver woman with 2 days of training saves the day. Everybody should point this as a big problem so maybe they would stop making this kind of situation in several recent movies. But people are always praising and giving good scores. I really can't understand. The film industry will not improve this way."
93,"MCU aside, this movie stands alone as an epic masterpiece on its own! The fight scenes were visually stunning, great acting, great story highly reccomend!"
94,"Incredibly boring and indifferent film, with stereotypical characters and a predictable story, following the superheroes formula. I watched the 3-D version, which looked like bad animation and completely distanced me from the film. The only redeeming qualities were a few inspired shots and the inclusion of some decent actors -- especially the wonderful Michelle Yeoh."
95,"I loved the cast, music, plot, everything. I especially loved Xialing because she was so powerful. Morris was also so so adorable. I really enjoyed all the action, as well as some comedic scenes and I'm so ready for the next Shang-Chi movie!"
96,This was fantastic. Saw it in theaters then again as soon as it was out on streaming too! The story and characters were great to explore; the action sequences and special effects keep you immersed; and the actors all made the story come to life.
97,"The buzz was high on this film but I kept my expectations modest. It started off as a charming story, well told and authentic. The action, and the acting were fine. Then the action dipped a little in the middle. But, once Shang Chi and his gang escaped the stronghold of the 10 rings, the movie really took off. It was a magnificent freaking story. The legend, the fighting, the story, and the tremendous acting were all there. This is as good an MCU movie as there ever was. I was totally blown away by it. It was a great idea to have top actors in the movie and let them do their thing. The leads Simu Liu and Akwafina are solid but the burden of carrying the movie isn't entirely placed on their shoulders. Their parents and auntie (Tony Leung, Fala Chen, and Michelle Yeoh) have to do some of the dramatic heavy lifting."
98,"The Action scenes were on par with the crouching tiger hidden dragon and other awesome awesome Kung Fu movies that that came before. There was bruce Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan is Jackie Chan elements to elements to the fight scenes.The comedy was not over the top or too much or forced into areas to break up the heavy drama. Like the Cape in Dr. Strange whipping away the tear.Hoodnmobie, better than I expected."
99,"Entertaining movie ..worth it ..the bus scene ..oh boy ..on loop ..overall visual treat , neat cgi and enjoyable marvel movie ..you will love it ..don't miss it."
